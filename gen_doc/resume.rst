Work Experience
===============

* March 2021 - Now

  + title: Research Scientist
  + company: Intel co.
  + duty:

    - extend RISC-V instructions based on Rocket core
    - test new instructions
    - research on agile hardware design

  + achievement:

    - realized RISC-V instructions based on Rocket core

* Jan 2021 - Feb 2021

  + title: Processor Engineer
  + company: Beijing Horizon Information Technology Co.
  + duty:

    - design performance monitor of AI Core

  + achievement:

    None

* July 2018 - Jan 2021

  + title: Processor Engineer
  + company: Sylincom Information Technology Co. Ltd.
  + duty: Build and lead the DSP team on:

    - Optimize the architecture for frequency and power;
    - Develop the tool chains;
    - Analyze the performance.

  + achievement:

    1. Build a team to design DSP core with tools chain and IPs.
       I built the team from two engineers to a full core and accelerator design team.
       In the team, there are three engineers on core, three engineers on tools including compiler(based on LLVM), debugger and simulator,
       and another three engineers on digital IPs.
    2. Realize a high performance DSP for baseband @ TSMC 28nm.
       This DSP targets LTE L1 digital signal process, such as modulation, layer mapping and DFT.
       My role was the project manager and architecture.
       I optimized the micro architecture of the core to import the frequency from 500MHz to 1GHz at 28nm with only one more pipeline stage.
       I also optimized the data path between SDRAM and core, reducing bus complexity.
       Compared with last version, new DSP had 100% rise in performance with only 50% rise in power.
    3. Design decoders of Tubor, LDPC, Polar for LTE/5G.
       In these project, my duty was to optimize the IPs' structure and balance the data exchange with other cores and IPs in the baseband chip.

* July 2016 - July 2018

  + title: Hardware Engineer
  + company: Potevio Information Technology Co. Ltd.
  + duty: Research on information security and IC card.

    1. Being in writing group of the research on critical information infrastructure defense ability;
    2. Researching authentication  technology  and  protocol, such as eID, PKI and IC cards;
    3. Attending the architecture design of one IC card soc.
  + achievement:

    1. One section of the reports on critical information infrastructure defense ability.
    2. Suggestion on the design of IC card soc.

* July 2008 - July 2016

  + title: Internship Hardware Engineer
  + company: Loongson Information Technology Co. Ltd.
  + duty: 

    While studying for doctorate degree, I worked in microprocessor lab, and gained rich experience in processor design. 
    
    I had attended two multi-core projects in which I started my physical design work and became a junior engineer who was responsible for the vector module independently. From the third year, I was responsible for the testchips which accompanied with the main processor, and on which integrated many cutting edge IPs.

    My main research field was optical interconnection on chip, and I focused on the protocol and circuit. I designed a prototype which connected two Loongson processors with fiber, by HT interface.
  + achievement:

    1. Get best student in the custom design team.
    2. Be responsible for the physical design of a vector module.
    3. Be responsible for testchips on many process nodes.
    4. Design the protocol of on-chip optical interconnection.
* PI/SI, ESD: some test support.
